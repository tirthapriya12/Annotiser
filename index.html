            Earth's Mightiest Heroes joined forces to take on threats that were too big for any one hero to tackle. With a roster that
            has included Captain America, Iron Man, Scarlet Witch, Hulk, Thor, Clint Barton and dozens more over the years,
            the Avengers have come to be regarded as Earth's No. 1 team.
